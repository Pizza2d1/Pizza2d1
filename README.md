## Hi there 👋
My name is Nathan / Pizza :pizza:

I am a mostly self-taught programmer that learns random languages to pick up for the fun of it, languages such as:

🟥Java

🟨PHP

🟩Python

🟦Bash

🟪C++ (just started)


I am in between many projects right now, including making a kubernetes+anisible raspberry pi cluster 🔗, soldering practice 🪛, creating my website to store/play files that my friends and I upload to it using my NAS made of a broken laptop 📃, and potentially in the future making a drone from scratch with my college's 3D printers 🛩️.

I hope you find some of my projects interesting as I try to make them as user-friendly as possible!
