My name is Nathan / Pizza :pizza:

I am a mostly self-taught programmer that learns random languages to pick up for the fun of it, languages such as:


 
🟥 Java                   <img align="right" width="300" height="300" src="https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=pizza2d1&theme=dark&layout=compact">               

🟨 PHP    

🟩 Python

🟦 Bash

🟪 C++ (just started)


I am in between many projects right now, including making a kubernetes+anisible raspberry pi cluster 🔗, soldering practice 🪛, creating my website to store/play files that my friends and I upload to it using my NAS made of a broken laptop 📃, and potentially in the future making a drone from scratch with my college's 3D printers 🛩️.

I hope you find some of my projects interesting as I try to make them as user-friendly as possible!
