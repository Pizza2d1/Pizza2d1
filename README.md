## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Nathan and I do bash scripting, its my main thing

Right now I am working on making my own kubernetes cluster so that I can quickly process and transcode multiple video files for personal purposes, I am also working on making a website that will host different files that can be downloaded for ease of access (but mostly so that I can access them without them being blocked by my school wifi).

I hope you find some of my projects interesting as I try to make them as user-friendly as possible!
